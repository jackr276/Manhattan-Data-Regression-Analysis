# NYC REGENTS Scores Regression Analysis
Author: [Jack Robbins](https://github.com/jackr276)

## Summary
Using scores from prior years of the NYS REGENTS Exams from New York City, for the years 2014-2019 across all subjects, this project performs data cleaning, analysis and creates a regression model using the data. Using over 35,000 records taken from NYC's open data portal, the model here can accurately predict the percentage of students who will score an 80% or above on a REGENTS test, given the year taken, exam given and mean score of the entire school. Numerous data science techniques are applied revolving around data cleaning, preprocessing, analysis and regression modeling. There is a full powerpoint presentation video shown below that walks through the process in depth, and there is extensive documentation in the source code file linked [here](https://github.com/jackr276/NYC-REGENTS-Scores-Regression-Analysis/blob/main/NYS%20REGENTS%20Scores.ipynb). I encourage anyone who is interested to watch through the presentation and look through the jupyter notebook file.
